<h1>Default HTML Mail Template</h1>
<h2>Replace this text with what you would like your email to look like</h2>
<p>You can use normal HTML as you would in any other email.</p>
<p>For sending out pardot emails, you are required to include the normal %%unsubscribe%% or %%email_preferences_center%% links as in any other pardot email template.</p>
<p>On top of those standard variables you can add custom ones that are fed with information from the wordpress post:</p>
<ul>
  <li>%%post_title%% will be populated with the post's header line</li>
  <li>%%post_content%% will be populated with the first paragraph or first 255 characters of the post content</li>
  <li>%%post_link%% will be populated with a link to the Wordpress post</li>
  <li>%%post_image_link%% will be populated with the link to the featured image</li>
</ul>
