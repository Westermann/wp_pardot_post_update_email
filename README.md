== Description ==

This is a very basic plugin that uses the pardot API to send an email out to prospects in a pardot list whenever any post is set from 'Pending Review' to 'Published'. The plugin is very useful if you want to manage your blog-subscribers and thus your organization's prospects through pardot as opposed to Wordpress's user system.
