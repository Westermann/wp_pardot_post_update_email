Default Text Mail Template
Replace this text with what you would like your email to look like
For sending out pardot emails, you are required to include the normal %%unsubscribe%% or %%email_preferences_center%% links as in any other pardot email template.
On top of those standard variables you can add custom ones that are fed with information from the wordpress post:
%%post_title%% will be populated with the post's header line
%%post_content%% will be populated with the first paragraph or first 255 characters of the post content
%%post_link%% will be populated with a link to the Wordpress post
%%post_image_link%% will be populated with the link to the featured image
